## Directions
First, pull this and save a copy of this project to your computer. 
Next, make sure you have two terminals open. Change the direction for one of them 
to be under the folder `client` and the other being `server`. 
Inside both of them, run `npm install` and then `npm run start`.

## Features
This chat app has two default rooms users can join, `#random` and `#general`. If none of these
works for them, they can click `New` and type in a name. Whenever a user joins the chat, the 
`System` announces to the room of a new user. The `System` also announces when a user leaves the
room. Emojis are translated after hitting sent thanks to the React-Emoji npm package. At any given time,
users in the room can see who is in the chat room.
